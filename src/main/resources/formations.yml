#
# Welcome! This file allows you to create unique formations. Please read carefully.
#
# =================================================================================================
# SECTION 1: BASIC STRUCTURE OF A FORMATION
# =================================================================================================
#
# your-unique-formation-id:             # A unique ID, no spaces or special characters.
#   display_name: "<red>Formation Name"  # Display name in-game, supports MiniMessage color codes.
#   activation_item: ...                # The item to activate the formation (See Section 2).
#   duration: "15m"                     # How long the formation lasts (t: tick, s: second, m: minute, h: hour). '0' for infinite.
#   radius: 20                          # The effect radius in blocks.
#   pattern: ...                        # The physical block structure (See Section 3).
#   particles: ...                      # Decorative particle effects (See Section 4).
#   effects: ...                        # The actual gameplay effects (See Section 5).
#
# =================================================================================================
# SECTION 2: ACTIVATION ITEM (activation_item)
# =================================================================================================
#
# METHOD 1: SIMPLE ITEM (By material name)
# The formation will activate with any item of this material.
#   activation_item: "DIAMOND"
#
# METHOD 2: UNIQUE ITEM (With custom name, lore, and a hidden tag to prevent fakes)
# Use /ttp giveitem <player> <formation_id> to get this specific item.
# It's unique because it has a hidden NBT tag.
#   activation_item:
#     material: "NETHER_STAR"
#     name: "<gold>Soul of the Formation"
#     lore:
#       - "<gray>An ancient artifact."
#       - "<blue>Channel your energy to activate."
#     enchantments:
#       - "unbreaking:1"
#
# =================================================================================================
